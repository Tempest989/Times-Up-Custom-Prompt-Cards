# Times Up Custom Prompt Cards
A display webpage for custom prompts made for the Time's Up board game. Was designed for personal use, but decided to place it on here in-case anyone wants to use it as well.  
**DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY CUSTOM PROMPTS SO YOU MUST PLACE IN YOUR OWN PROMPTS!!**  
Was designed and tested on PC, and has yet to be tested on mobile devices so unsure if it works properly on those.

## How to Use

- Must **ADD** in your own custom prompts to the Javascript "*script.js*" file in the format shown at the top of that file, then save the file and reload the webpage and if done correctly, all your custom prompts should be loaded in.
- Follow the button prompts accordingly to play.
- Each card is only drawn from the deck when the card is flipped face up, so clicking "Draw 3 New Cards" does **NOT** imediately draw 3 cards from the deck, each card is only drawn when it is flipped face up via clicking on said card.

## Improvements / What's Left?

- Might add in a button that checks if there are any duplicate prompts present in the custom prompts, to save time on having to carefully check individually if a new prompt is a repeat prompt.

## Thanks for Reading and Enjoy!
